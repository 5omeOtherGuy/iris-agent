## 0 · Reading this document

Iris is not a web app wearing a terminal costume; it is a **monospace
character-cell interface** that we translate faithfully to the web. Every rule
below is stated in terminal terms first (cells, rows, glyphs) and then in its
CSS translation. When a rule and its translation seem to conflict, honour the
terminal intent.

The unit of measure is **one cell** — one monospace character width (`1ch`) and
one line of the terminal grid. "Two cells of indent" means `2ch`, not "about
16px". Vertical rhythm is measured in **blank lines**, not pixels.

---

## 1 · The pane — global anatomy

Iris is a **single vertically scrolling transcript column** framed by a quiet
**session bar pinned at the top** and a **fixed multiline composer pinned at
the bottom**. That is the entire chrome. There is:

- **no sidebar** — no file tree, no history rail, no agent avatar;
- **no top tab bar** — the session bar is one quiet row (location + context),
  not a toolbar;
- **no separate bottom status bar** — the runtime statusline lives *inside*
  the composer, below the input, so status and input are one object;
- **no floating toolbars, no FABs, no cards, no panels-beside-panels.**

The statusline is **split** across the two ends of the pane, and the two
halves are never merged onto one line again:

- **Session bar (pane top — "where am I / how full am I"):** `cwd ┊ git
  branch` left, the right-aligned context readout `CTX <used>/<cap>` + 10-dot
  meter right, over a soft (dim) hairline.
- **Composer statusline (pane bottom — "what am I running"):** mode · model ·
  effort · approval policy, below the input rows.

```

**Shared measure.** Tool panels and the composer indent **2 cells** from the
pane edge and share **one width**. Transcript text (user + assistant) aligns to
a single **text column** (see §7). Nothing is full-bleed: the docked overlays
(§10) inset to the same measure, never a full-screen scrim. The only centred
surface is the start-page launcher (§12.5).

**Max width (web).** In a browser recreation the column caps at `--pane-max`
(900px) and centres in the viewport on the flat `bg`. In a real terminal it is
the terminal width.

**Vertical rhythm.** Exactly **one blank line** (`--block-rhythm`, 1.5rem)
separates every top-level block: user turn, assistant message, thinking block,
plan, notice, each tool block, the working indicator, and the turn divider. The
calm of the interface comes from **varying nothing else.** Never 0.5-line,
never 2-line gaps; never a gap that depends on block type.

---

### 1.1 Screen modes — pager & inline

The pane anatomy above is rendered by one of two backends
([ADR-0029](adr/0029-adopt-alt-screen-pager-tui.md)). Both render the same
logical `Screen` state; the design language is identical in both.

| Mode | Surface | Session bar | Scrollback |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Pager** (rich default once stable) | Alternate screen, full-frame ratatui `Terminal`, synchronized updates | Literally viewport-pinned (rows 0–1) | Iris-owned scroll offset; native scrollback unused |
| **Inline** (automatic fallback) | Scrollback-append terminal surface (ADR-0006) | Top of the rendered document; scrolls with history | Native terminal scrollback |

In pager mode the mouse is captured by default (wheel scrolls the Iris-owned
scrollback); Ctrl+T or `/mouse` toggles capture off to restore
terminal-native select/copy, and the composer statusline shows a dim
`○ mouse off` hint while off. Copy paths: native clipboard tools, then
OSC 52 (`/copy`).

Mode policy: `tui.altScreen = "auto" | "always" | "never"` in settings,
`--no-alt-screen`, `IRIS_NO_ALT_SCREEN=1`. `auto` selects the pager on plain
terminals and normal tmux; tmux control mode, Zellij, `TERM=dumb`, and
non-TTY stdio degrade to inline with a one-line notice. `--plain` remains the
ANSI-free text path. Detection failures degrade to inline, never to a broken
alt screen.

---

## 2 · Color

**Terminal-relative.** Every role binds to an ANSI named slot so Iris inherits
the user's own light/dark terminal theme. The hexes below are the **dark-mode
reference approximations** (from `src/ui/tui.rs`); `tokens/colors.css` is the
source of truth for the values and ships a light theme under
`:root[data-theme="light"]`.

### 2.1 Foundation (grey does the structural work)

| Role | Token | Dark hex | ANSI | Job |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Background | `--iris-bg` | `#1a1a1f` | Reset bg | The entire canvas. Flat. |
| Surface | `--iris-surface` | `#323238` | `Rgb(50,50,56)` | Selection / active-row fill **only**. |
| Ink | `--iris-ink` | `#e6e6e6` | Reset fg | Default body text. |
| Border | `--iris-border` | `#808080` | Gray | Panel & composer frames. |
| Muted | `--iris-muted` | `#6b6b6b` | DarkGray | Metadata, hints, markers, elisions. |
| Stdout | `--iris-stdout` | `#b7b7bd` | — | SHELL program output (below the command). |

Grey carries the whole layout. If you can express a distinction with
weight/case/dim instead of a hue, do.

### 2.2 Signal (sparse, role-assigned)

| Role | Token | Dark hex | ANSI | Used for |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Accent | `--iris-accent` | `#d78700` | orange | Active mode `◉`, running `●`, meter edge dot, warning `▲`. |
| Interactive | `--iris-interactive` | `#00afaf` | Cyan | Selection focus, inline code. |
| Link | `--iris-link` | `#5f87ff` | Blue | Links only. |
| Success | `--iris-success` | `#5faf5f` | Green | `◆` DONE, diff additions. |
| Danger | `--iris-danger` | `#d75f5f` | Red | `■` ERROR/DENIED, diff removals, stderr. |

### 2.3 Two laws of color

1. **Never color a whole panel or region.** Color is a point signal (a glyph, a
   word, one diff row's faint tone), never a fill behind content. The single
   permitted tonal fill is `--iris-surface` for a selected/active row.
2. **Never rely on color alone.** Every stateful thing pairs a **symbol + label**
   with its color, and the UI must be fully legible in monochrome. A red word
   with no `■` and no "ERROR" is a bug.

### 2.4 Diff tone

Additions/removals get a **whisper** of background — `color-mix` of the
success/danger role at ~10% into the pane bg — plus tinted text and a `+`/`−`
marker. The marker and text carry the signal; the tone only groups the hunk.
Never a saturated block.

---

## 3 · Type

**One family:** the user's terminal monospace. Web substitute: **JetBrains
Mono** (complete box-drawing coverage, even cell widths), loaded from Google
Fonts; swap the stack in `tokens/typography.css` for a house font or offline
build.

**There is no size axis.** The terminal has one cell size (`--fs-base`, 14px on
the web). Hierarchy is built from five levers, in this order of preference:

1. **Weight** — `400` body · `500` actor lines / active items · `700` labels & headings.
2. **Dim / bright** — muted grey recedes; ink advances; stdout sits between.
3. **Color** — only per §2 (sparse, always symbol-paired).
4. **Case** — UPPERCASE for structural labels only (see §11).
5. **The marker/symbol column** — a leading glyph is itself a level of hierarchy.

The `--fs-*` steps exist **only** so web chrome (specimen cards, README) has a
sane base. **Never introduce a larger font size to make something important in
the pane** — reach for weight, then case, then a marker.

**Line rhythm:** `--leading-base` 1.5 for prose/panels; `--leading-tight` 1.35
where density matters. Uppercase labels get `--tracking-label` (0.06em).

**Wrapping is semantic.** Break at spaces, `/`, `&&`, and token boundaries.
**Never** break an identifier, a path, or a decimal; **never** let a line
overflow a border. Continuation lines align under the content column, not the
marker (see §7, §8).

---

## 4 · Spacing & rhythm (exact)

| Token | Value | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `--cell` | `1ch` | One character width — the grid unit. |
| `--pane-indent` | `2ch` | Tool blocks & composer indent from the pane edge. |
| `--marker-gap` | `2ch` | User `›` marker → its text (the marker occupies the gutter; the body hangs on the text column). |
| body hang | `4ch` | Body indent: one 2-cell step under the header **label**. Every block's body — tool, thinking rail, and a user turn's own text — lands on this ONE shared text column. |
| `--block-rhythm` | `1.5rem` | The one blank line between top-level blocks. |
| `--line` | `1.5em` | One line of vertical rhythm. |

**The indentation ladder (one rule, three steps).** Indentation is hierarchy,
and it steps in units of 2 cells, the same everywhere:

- **col 2 — the gutter:** a row's identity glyph. A foldable block's disclosure
  `▾`/`▸` (tool *and* thinking) and a user turn's `›` live here; nothing else.
- **col 4 — the label/marker column:** tool & thinking **labels**, tool footers,
  the tool block's `┊` body spine (§8.1) and the thinking `┊` body rail, and the
  user's `›` marker.
- **col 6 — the text column:** *every* body — user prose, agent prose, tool
  output, reasoning — hangs here, one step under its header/marker.

**One right rail.** All right-aligned readouts — tool `elapsed`, footer
diagnostics, and the thinking-rail telemetry (`↓tokens elapsed`) — align to a
single vertical at the block's right edge (`width − pane-indent`). The reasoning
readout is not inset further than the tool elapsed; if they don't line up, it is
a bug. Tool headers and the reasoning rail share ONE geometry builder so the two
cannot drift.

**Golden rule:** inside a tool block every row is exactly **one** of
{ header · body · footer rule · footer } and **all rows share one width**. The
column discipline is the design: left edges (disclosure · label · body · state
label) and the single right rail (elapsed · op metas · diagnostics) make the
transcript scan as a table without drawing one.

---

## 5 · The symbol vocabulary (complete)

Iris has **no icon font, no SVG icon set, no emoji — ever.** Its entire "icon
system" is this closed set of Unicode glyphs rendered in the cell grid. Each
glyph has **exactly one job.** Do not introduce new glyphs; do not reuse one for
a second meaning.

```
STATE / ACTIVITY
  ◉  active / selected mode (orange)        ●  running · live LED (orange)
  ◆  done / success (green)                 ◇  preview / pending (muted)
  ■  error / denied (red)                   ▲  warning (orange)
  □  skipped / cancelled (muted)            ○  queued / empty meter slot (muted)

TRANSCRIPT

FRAME (box-drawing, square corners ONLY)
  ┌ ┐ └ ┘   corners        │  vertical        ─  horizontal        ├ ┤  tees
```

**Punctuation law:** use the ellipsis `…` (never `...`); use the Unicode minus
`−` for removals (never ASCII `-`); use `┊` as the soft separator (never ASCII
`|`). A glyph is added only when it carries meaning — do not decorate.

**Git/task senses (exact, one job each):**

- `⇡` / `⇣` — ahead/behind the **last-fetched** upstream, git console only.
  `↑`/`↓` remain token telemetry ONLY; never reuse them for sync state.
- `±` — uncommitted modification relative to committed state: diff modified
  rows, the session-bar dirty count, and user-attributed dirty files. One
  meaning everywhere.
- `◇` — pending / not yet settled ("exists, awaiting acceptance"): tool
  previews AND unsettled Iris task changes (ADR-0028). One meaning.
- `▲` conflicts / `■` detached — the existing warning/error roles paired with
  a label (`▲2`, `■ detached @ 46b104`), never color alone.
- `WT` — a boxed **text tag**, not a glyph, marking a linked worktree.
  Staged/untracked counts are **words** (`1 staged · 3 untracked`); `+`/`○`
  keep their single jobs.
- TAB inside a create input toggles the creation **target** (branch ⇄
  worktree). Distinct from the SlashMenu's tab-to-accept, which is a
  completion context; a target toggle never completes text.

The only raster/vector brand asset is the hero banner (`assets/hero-*.svg`),
itself a monospace specimen (LED strip + `›` + tagline, one orange accent).

---

## 6 · Elevation, borders, motion, transparency

- **Flat by construction.** No z-layers in the transcript; `--radius: 0`
  everywhere (square corners are intrinsic to box-drawing). No decorative
  shadows, no faux-3D, no gradients, no textures, no images (except the hero).
- **Depth is structural.** Tool output is unboxed text like the rest of the
  transcript; structure comes from the block grammar (header · hanging body ·
  hairline footer) and its two alignment rails, not from a frame. The composer
  keeps its frame — it is the only hard chrome on screen.
- **No shadows anywhere.** Overlays (§10) are docked, **frameless** menus that
  reserve rows above the composer and shift the editor down — not a floating
  layer over the pane. No cast shadow, no scrim, no blur, no glass; the pane is
  flat and fully opaque throughout. The composer's top edge is the only frame.
- **Motion is physics, and it is quantized.** Every sanctioned motion is a
  discrete step on the loop's tick grid — machines step, they do not ease. The
  closed set:
  1. the **LED-chase working indicator** (`●··· → ·●·· → ··●· → ···●`) and the
     IrisMark's idle ping-pong sweep — the only *looping* motions, and they run
     only while something is genuinely live;
  2. the **edge-dot pulse** on the context meter / running symbol at high usage;
  3. the **power-on lamp test** (§12.5) — the start page's one-shot boot: the
     strip fills two LEDs per tick, holds all-lit for two ticks, releases. Runs
     once, on the start page only, and any key completes it instantly;
  4. the **detent flash** — when a bottom-statusline segment changes (model,
     effort, approval policy), the context meter lights a new LED, or a
     settings-panel control clicks to a new position (§10.1), the changed
     element alone renders bright for two ticks, then settles: the mechanical
     acknowledgment that a switch clicked into a new position. Never fires from
     startup initialization (it is armed only once the first frame settles), so
     a flash is always news.
  No braille spinners, no rainbow meters, no easing, no fades, no ambient
  motion. Everything above degrades to its **static settled state** under
  `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` / `IRIS_REDUCED_MOTION`.
- **Interaction states are quiet.** Hover/selected rows in overlays use the
  `surface` fill — never a colored left-border accent. Focus is the cyan
  interactive role. State changes are reported by the symbol vocabulary, not by
  shrink/scale/bounce.

---

## 7 · Transcript grammar — conversation

Natural-language conversation is **unboxed and light.** Chrome (frames) is
reserved for mechanical tool events (§8). The transcript text column is the
shared body column (§4): the `›` marker width (`1ch`) + `--marker-gap` (`2ch`)
past the pane indent — the same column tool and reasoning bodies hang on.

### 7.1 User message
**The one turn the transcript marks.** An ink-weight `›` sits in the gutter (col
2) on the first line of the turn; the body hangs on the shared text column, and
**wrapped lines align under the text, not the marker.** Only the first line is
marked — a multi-line ask reads as one block under one `›`. The marker is the
whole treatment: **no USER label, no border, no role card, no bubble, no
avatar.** Monochrome-safe — marker + position carry it, never color. Why mark the
user and not the agent? The agent is the transcript's dominant voice (messages,
tools, reasoning); marking *it* would decorate the default. The user's turns are
sparse, and the `›` is the anchor the eye jumps to — "what did I ask?" One blank
line separates turns.

### 7.2 Assistant message
**The agent speaks unmarked.** Its body sits on the shared text column with a
blank gutter — no `›`, never boxed, never an "AGENT" label. Content is rendered
through the **markdown grammar** (§7.3). (Historically the `›` marked the
assistant; it now marks the user, §7.1.)

Voice inside: terse, factual, present-tense reports of *what happened* — "Done;
emit() now budgets before sending. The diff is above." Never "I think", "I'll go
ahead and", "Let me". No enthusiasm performance, no emoji.

### 7.3 Markdown grammar (assistant rich text)
Iris speaks prose but carries structure. GFM is rendered in the terminal idiom —
hierarchy from weight/case/color/marker, **never a size jump**:

| Construct | Rendering |
|---|---|
| Heading `#`–`####` | Bold ink, no size change. `#` (h1) gets uppercase + label tracking. |
| **Bold** | `--fw-bold` ink. |
| *Italic* | Slanted (JetBrains Mono italic). |
| `Inline code` | Cyan interactive, monospace (already monospace — color is the cue). |
| `[link](url)` | Link blue, **dotted** underline, 2px offset. |
| Fenced ```` ``` ```` | `CodeBlock`: quiet **left rail**, muted `lang · file` caption, ink body, horizontal scroll. **Never boxed**. |
| List `-`/`*`/`+` | Muted `•` marker column, hanging indent. |
| List `1.` | Muted right-aligned `1.` marker column. |
| Blockquote `>` | Muted **left rail**, muted text. |
| Rule `---` | A single muted `─` line (50% opacity). |
| Table | Aligned monospace columns, **bold header**, one `─` separator row, ink body. No vertical rules. |

### 7.4 Thinking block
The agent's raw reasoning. Reasoning is internal, secondary, verbose, and **not
a mechanical event**, so it gets **no chrome.** It is the most recessive thing in
the pane: a muted `THINKING` label, dim-grey body behind a quiet **left rail**
(the `┊`, never a box), and generated-token telemetry. Its **header shares the
tool block's geometry** (§4, §8.1): the disclosure `▾`/`▸` sits in the gutter
(col 2), the label on the label column (col 4), and the telemetry
(`↓tokens elapsed`) on the single right rail — so reasoning and tools scan on one
grid, and the readout is never inset further than a tool's elapsed. Only the
muted label tone and the `┊` body rail (at col 4, its text hanging at col 6) mark
it as recessive. Folds by default (progressive disclosure); `ctrl+o` / header
toggles `▾`⇄`▸`. Live reasoning pulses (`●` in the label, `▋` caret at the tail);
finished reasoning may collapse to a line + token count. Short reasoning is shown
whole and is not foldable (the arrow drops, but the gutter stays so the label
holds its column).

### 7.5 Plan list
The agent's task checklist. **Unboxed** (narration, not a tool event): a muted
`PLAN` label with a `done/total` count, then one row per step carrying its state
as a glyph — `◆` done (recedes, muted text) · `●` active (orange, pulses,
bright+bold) · `○` pending (muted) · `□` skipped (muted). Never color alone; a
step may carry a muted trailing note.

### 7.6 Notice (system message)
A runtime event that is neither a tool call nor the assistant: context
compaction, interrupt, undo, connection retry, rate-limit, model switch. Unboxed
and quiet. State is a glyph: `┊` info (muted) · `■` error (red) — the info glyph
is the same soft rail the reasoning trace uses, never a color alone.

A notice is a **left-rail aside**, not a floating tick. It renders on the text
column (`┊` at col 4, message at col 6), **word-wraps** (never truncates), and an
info notice re-emits the `┊` rail on every continuation row — byte-for-byte the
reasoning body rail (§"reasoning rail"). An error leads its first line with `■`
and hangs its continuation under the message.

**A run of notices shares one rail.** When several fire back-to-back (a
compaction's runtime event plus the `/compact` command's own lines; a fold's
itemized reclaim), they coalesce: one blank separator opens the run, siblings sit
directly under one another with **no interior blank**, and one blank closes it.
The rail connects them into a single quiet aside instead of scattering ticks
through whitespace. No caption `hint` / keybind is rendered unless a real binding
exists (keymap honesty — there is no undo, so compaction shows none).

```
› /compact

┊ Context compacted — 82.6k → 726 tokens
┊ compacted 155 earlier message(s): ~82581 tokens replaced by a
┊ ~726-token summary
┊ Folded 3 spent tool result(s) — reclaimed ~12.4k tokens [B]

```

### 7.7 Working indicator
An **inline** LED-chase readout shown while the agent runs. Never framed, never
a braille spinner, one line:

```
●···  1:27 ┊ ESC ┊ ↑177k ↓5.7k
```

The lit cell bounces across a 4-cell strip. One blank line above/below when
adjacent to other blocks. Telemetry (`↑`/`↓`) and the `ESC` hint are optional.

### 7.8 Turn divider
A quiet unboxed rule rendered **after a tool-backed agent turn** (not after
purely conversational turns). Compact elapsed + optional token telemetry with
`┊` separators; **never** `T+`. One blank line above and below.

```
── 7.6s ┊ ↑18.2k ↓846 ───────────────────────────────────
```

## 8 · Tool-block grammar — the frameless families

The **tool block** is Iris's primary structured-output primitive. It is
**frameless**: no border, no background, no header/body separator — unboxed
text, like the rest of the transcript. Every block is **header · body ·
footer**, stacked, sharing one width at the 2-cell tool indent. The transcript
families are **EXPLORE / SHELL / EDIT**. Approval is not a family — it is a
lifecycle state a SHELL/EDIT block passes through in place (§8.5). Never invent
another family; never render standalone `READ` / `GREP` / `LS` panels.

### 8.1 Shared block grammar
```
▾ TOOL  meta                                                        ELAPSED
   ┊ <body — rides the `┊` spine, one 2-cell step under the label; unmounts collapsed>
   ┊─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   ◆ DONE  [family extras]             ↑sent ↓recv ┊ cache <n> ┊ ctx <Δ%>
```
**Header** — disclosure `▾`/`▸` (muted) · bold uppercase family label · muted
meta (a path, scope, or the shell command), truncating with `…` · right edge
carries **only the elapsed time** (omitted for a pending `preview`). No state
symbol in the header — the state lives in the footer.

**Spine** — an expanded block reads as ONE unit because a **dim `┊` rail** fills
the label/marker column (col 4, one 2-cell step left of the shared text column)
on every body row: a continuous left edge running from under the header label,
down the body, into the footer hairline and the footer state token. It is the
same soft-rail grammar the reasoning rail and the coalesced notices use — a
**rail, not a frame** (no top edge, no right edge, no box); tool output stays
primary (full-ink content, bold label), reasoning stays recessive (dim). A
**collapsed** block unmounts its body, so the spine shows only when expanded —
exactly when the header and footer are pulled apart and the block would
otherwise float. The rail sits *outside* any diff-row background fill.

**Footer** — the block's last row, always visible, opened by a muted hairline
rule from the body indent to the right rail. Left edge: the **state token** — the
state glyph (`◆ DONE` · `■ ERROR` · `◇ PREVIEW` · `● RUNNING` · `□ CANCELLED` ·
`▲ REVIEW` · `■ DENIED`), colored by state, then the uppercase label. Prominence
is **proportional**: the consequential states — `ERROR`, `DENIED`, `REVIEW` —
keep a **bold** label (news the user must read or act on); the settled-success
and transient states — `DONE`, `RUNNING`, `CANCELLED`, `PREVIEW` — recede, the
colored glyph carrying the state while the label stays **muted, un-bold**, so a
transcript that is mostly successful calls does not shout a column of bold
labels. The glyph is deliberately lossy — `Error` and `Denied` share `■` — and
the **label carries the distinction the shape cannot**. After it, `┊`-joined
family extras (EDIT counts + note, SHELL `EXIT <code>` + result meta, or an
in-review block's danger-toned reason + decision affordance / approval note). Right-bound:
the optional token diagnostics cluster, all muted, honest (rendered only when
measured). The `┊` law: only BETWEEN sibling fields, one space each side,
never leading/trailing, never after the state label — fields are joined
programmatically so a missing field can never leave a dangling `┊`.

**Disclosure** — binary, whole-block. Expanded (`▾`) = header + body +
footer; collapsed (`▸`) = header + footer, exactly two rows, body
**unmounted** — no partial preview, no elision affordance. **Compact by
default**: every foldable block **arrives collapsed** regardless of body
size (the two rows still answer *what ran · on what · how long · outcome ·
cost*). Two exceptions: a **running** block stays expanded on its bounded
live tail (it collapses when it finalizes unless the user explicitly
expanded it), and a **pending preview / review** (`◇ PREVIEW`, `REVIEW`)
arrives expanded so its body can be inspected before deciding (it collapses
once applied/settled). `ctrl+o` toggles **all** foldable
blocks at once — tool blocks and thinking rails: if any is collapsed it
expands them all, otherwise it collapses them all. A **click on a block's
header row** toggles that one block. State is per-block; an explicit user
expand/collapse survives the block's in-place rebuilds.

`/find` searches canonical transcript content — the body of a collapsed block
is searched even though it is unmounted from the view. Jumping to a match
inside a collapsed block expands it; the newest match stays clear of the find
indicator row.

### 8.2 EXPLORE — read / grep / list / find
The **single container** for every read-side op. Each op is **one row**:
```
VERB  target [code][after]                                    meta(count)
```
- `verb` (fixed 5-cell column, medium weight): `Read` · `Grep` · `List` · `Find`.
- `target` ink path; `code` cyan (a grep pattern); `after` muted (` in src/…`).
- `meta` muted count, right-bound at the block's right rail (`142 lines`,
  `3 matches · 2 files`).

Never break a read op into its own block — batch them here. The EXPLORE footer
is state + diagnostics only (no family extras).

### 8.3 SHELL — command execution
Header meta is the command. Body line types, in the recessive order below (the
command is brightest, output recedes):

| `type` | Rendering |
|---|---|
| `cmd` | Bright ink, medium weight, quiet muted `$ ` prompt (non-selectable). |
| `out` | Recessive **stdout** grey, below the command. |
| `err` | **Danger** red (stderr). |
| `note` | Muted aside. |

A live command streams a bounded tail in the body (with an honest
`… N earlier lines hidden` marker) and has **no exit field yet**. A finished
command reports its status in the **footer**: `EXIT <code>` (bold, uppercase,
muted) then the honest result meta as a sibling field —
`DONE  EXIT 0 ┊ 142 passed` / `ERROR  EXIT 101 ┊ cargo bench failed`. The
footer state comes from the result (`exit 0` → done, else error); an unknown
exit status is omitted, never guessed.

### 8.4 EDIT — mutation & diff preview
**One canonical body:** the wrapped **block diff** (`DiffBlock`) for every file
type (code, prose, config, markdown). The footer carries the counts as ONE
field (`+n` add-ink, `−n` del-ink, 1ch apart) plus a muted note (`new file`).
Use `state="preview"` (**no elapsed**) for a pending apply; `state="done"`
once applied.

### 8.5 Approval — the gated block's own review lifecycle
Approval is **not a family** and never a separate panel or docked box. A gated
call is reviewed **inside its own tool block** (SHELL or EDIT): the block's
footer **state label walks the lifecycle** —
`REVIEW → RUNNING → DONE`/`ERROR` when approved, or `REVIEW → DENIED` when
refused. One block, start to finish; the tool's command/diff is never
duplicated in a second block.

- **`REVIEW`** (orange, no elapsed) **arrives expanded** — you must see what
  you authorize. The body is the block's own body: the `$ command` (SHELL) or
  the **diff** (EDIT). The footer carries, in order: an optional **danger-toned
  reason** (`destructive` · `N pre-existing changes` · `unsandboxed`) in the
  danger role, then the `┊`-joined **decision affordance** — `y approve ┊ n
  deny` plus `a always` / `p project` **only when the loop offers them**; deny
  is always available.
- **Manual approval** folds a muted **note** into that same footer (`approved
  this time` / `approved this session` / `approved this project`) and drops the
  affordance in place; the block then flips to `RUNNING` when it starts, and the
  note rides through to `DONE`.
- **Auto-approval carries no chrome** — the tool block alone is the record.
- **EDIT** review reuses the preview block: `◇ PREVIEW → REVIEW` flips **in
  place** (the diff IS the review surface), then `RUNNING → DONE`, or `DENIED`.
- **`DENIED`** (red, no elapsed) is terminal: the tool never ran, so the block
  is the honest record of what was proposed and declined.

### 8.6 Diff rendering (`DiffBlock`) — shared by EDIT & the in-block review
Columns: **line number** (right-aligned, muted, non-selectable) · **marker**
(1 cell) · **content** (wraps; continuations align under content). Markers:
`+` addition (green + faint add-tone bg), `−` removal (red + faint del-tone bg,
**Unicode minus**), `±` modified (accent), ` ` context (plain ink). Tone + text
+ marker together — never color alone.

---

## 9 · Session chrome — the session bar & the composer

The statusline is split across the pane: the **session bar** (top) answers
"where am I / how full am I"; the **composer statusline** (bottom) answers
"what am I running". The two halves are never merged onto one line again.

### 9.1 Session bar (pane top)

A quiet, always-visible row pinned above the transcript (the transcript
scrolls beneath it), with one soft hairline under it (dim `─` repeat — NOT the
full border weight; visibly lighter than the composer's top edge). No
background fill, no color bar.

```
~/iris-agent ┊ git main                      CTX 94k/300k ●●●○○○○○○○
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

- **Left:** `<cwd> ┊ git <branch> [state cluster]` — cwd in body ink, `┊` and
  `git <branch>` dim. Paths middle-ellipsize (never break; the project name
  survives). In a worktree, the worktree path is the cwd and a dim `[WT]` tag
  follows the cluster.
- **State cluster** (mutually exclusive base states, precedence order):
  1. unmerged `▲N` (orange) — overrides everything until resolved;
  2. task-partitioned `±N ◇M` — `±N` orange = user-attributed dirty files,
     `◇M` dim = Iris-unsettled ledger files; either half omitted at zero;
  3. plain dirty `±N` (orange) — one number, no task;
  4. clean — no glyph. Silence is the signal.
  Detached HEAD renders `■ detached @ <short-sha>` in place of the branch. No
  `⇡⇣` at rest — sync is git-console detail.
- **Right, right-aligned:** `CTX <used>/<cap>` + the 10-dot LED meter. `CTX`
  and `/<cap>` dim; `<used>` body ink. Unknown context window: `CTX <used>`
  with no meter.
- **Narrow widths, drop in order:** meter → `/<cap>` → counts (`±2 ◇3` →
  `±`) → `WT` tag → whole git segment → middle-truncate the cwd harder.
  Minimum form: cwd alone.

#### 9.1.1 SessionBar disclosures — the directory tree & the git console

Two momentary dropdowns share one slot under the bar: the **directory tree**
(from the cwd; `/tree`, or `@` as the first character of an empty composer —
opens straight into filter mode) and the **git console** (from the git
segment; `ctrl-g` or `/git`). They are **top chrome, not overlays**: rows
render between the bar and its soft hairline (which becomes the closing rule),
pushing the transcript down — plain `bg`, no box, no shadow, no scrim. At most
one is open; opening one closes the other; a docked modal or approval closes
both. A dim `▾ ` prefixes the open dropdown's segment only while it is open.
Height caps at 16 rows or ⅓ of the pane.

- **Focus:** `Editor < Palette < SessionMenu < Modal`. While open the dropdown
  owns keys; `esc` closes it and never reaches the turn-interrupt path. The
  **list-state law**: while a LIST has focus there is no free typing —
  single-letter commands (`a r n w s /`) are legal only there; any INPUT row
  (filter, create) makes printable keys text, always.
- **While a turn runs** dropdowns open as READOUTS: rows dim, every mutating
  key is a no-op, and the footer reads `● agent running ┊ read-only — actions
  return when idle ┊ esc`.
- **Git console** = the settlement surface for ADR-0028 tasks: a dim status
  line (`main → origin/main ┊ ±2 yours · 1 staged · 3 untracked ┊ ⇡2 ┊ stash
  1 ┊ 3h ago`), a TASK group (`a accept ┊ r roll back` — `r` swaps in the
  restore-point sublist from `restore_points()`), a SWITCH list (≤8 recent
  branches, `[WT]` rows redirect to "open session there"), and a WORKTREES
  board with `◇ unsettled · <age>` badges. Switching with dirt confirms first
  (settle / stash / carry); conflicts disable switching. `n`/`w` create a
  branch/worktree from the selected base — TAB toggles the target, validation
  gates `↵`, and the resolved worktree path (config `worktreeRoot`, default
  `../wt`) is always visible before create. Settlement goes through the
  existing `GitSafety` API only.
- **Directory tree**: breadcrumb (parents dim, clickable re-root up), 2-cell
  indent per level, `▾`/`▸` disclosure on dirs — no box-drawing tree guides.
  Attribution metas from the task partition: `◇ iris` dim, `± yours` orange,
  `◉ open` for the composer-referenced file. `↵` on a file inserts
  `@<relative-path>` into the composer; `/` filters flat (parent path as dim
  meta). Data: `git ls-files --cached --others --exclude-standard`, plain
  readdir outside a repo; 500 visible rows, then a dim `… N more` row.
- These are **disclosures, not sidebars**: invariant #1 stands — nothing
  persistent, nothing beside the transcript.

#### 9.1.2 Pinned prompt band (the governing prompt)

When the newest user prompt has scrolled above the viewport, its text is pinned
as a quiet **band** directly under the session bar, so the reader always knows
which prompt the visible content answers (grok `sticky_headers`). It reads as an
extension of the top chrome — **not** a card floating in the transcript.

```
~/iris-agent ┊ git main                      CTX 94k/300k ●●●○○○○○○○
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────  ← session bar hairline

  › the prompt the visible answer belongs to, dimmed…
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────  ← band hairline (SAME rule)
```

- **Same columns as the transcript.** The `›` marker sits on the user column
  (col 4) and the body hangs at col 6 — a prompt looks identical whether pinned
  or scrolled into view (§7.1). Continuation lines hang unmarked at col 6.
- **Dim throughout.** The band is a pinned *reference*, not the live turn: the
  whole prompt is `dim`, the differentiator from the ink transcript below. The
  marker keeps its `›`+bold glyph; only the tone changes. Not orange, no fill.
- **Closed by the session bar's own hairline.** The band's bottom rule is the
  **same** inset dim `─` the session bar draws (col 2 → width−2), byte-for-byte —
  never the composer's full-width border weight. Two matching hairlines bracket
  the band as one top-chrome region.
- **Capped.** A long prompt is truncated to three physical lines with a trailing
  `…`; the full text is one scroll away. The band never grows to eat the view.
- Yields the top row to an interactive overlay (a selection or search match
  revealed exactly at the viewport top keeps its highlight).

### 9.2 The composer

**Always present at the bottom. Never hidden, revealed, or collapsed** — there
is no show/hide mechanic anywhere. Row order, top → bottom:

```
────────────────────────────────────────────  ← top edge: full border-frame hairline
Give Iris a task...                           ← input rows (1 → 8)
╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌╌  ← internal rule: lighter hairline
◉ CODE ─ GPT-5.5 XHIGH ─ ◆ always-approve     ← bottom statusline
```

Exactly this **two-weight rule**: the top edge (separating composer from
transcript) is the full `border-frame` hairline; the rule between the input
and the statusline is a lighter internal hairline (the same soft weight panels
use internally). There is no other chrome option.

### 9.3 Bottom statusline (the composer's last row)
`◉ MODE ─ MODEL EFFORT ─ <policy-symbol> <policy>`. The `◉` is orange; `MODE`
bold uppercase; ` ─ ` dim separators; model name is an **underlined button**
(opens the model `Picker`); effort is muted. The approval-policy segment is
state symbol + label, never color alone:

| Posture | Segment |
|---|---|
| always-approve | `◆` green + dim label |
| on-request | `▲` orange + dim label |
| read-only | `■` red + dim label |
| off (approvals disabled) | `○` dim + dim label |

**Narrow widths, drop in order:** policy → effort → minimum `◉ CODE ─ MODEL`.
cwd/branch/context NEVER appear here — they live on the session bar.

### 9.4 Input row
A single editable row directly beneath the top edge, growing **1 → 8 rows** as
the user types. Caret is the orange accent. Placeholder uses exact product
casing: `Give Iris a task...`. Submit on `↵`; `shift+↵` for newline.

### 9.5 Command palette (`/`)
Typing a leading `/` opens the `SlashMenu` **above** the input: an overlay list
of `command  —  one-line description`; `↑`/`↓` navigate, `↵`/`Tab` accept,
`esc` dismisses. The highlighted row uses the `surface` fill (no accent border).
Canonical commands: `/model` · `/diff` · `/undo` · `/compact` · `/clear` ·
`/copy`.

### 9.6 File reference (`@`)
`@` references a workspace file (a path completion). Same overlay idiom.

### 9.7 The exit receipt

When a session that ran at least one turn ends, Iris prints **one dim line**
after terminal teardown — the instrument's printed slip, landing in normal
terminal scrollback in both screen modes (in pager mode it is the only trace
of the run; inline it closes the transcript):

```
iris 0.1.0 ┊ 12m ┊ 3 turns ┊ ↑412k ↓18.9k ┊ cache 88%
```

Fields, in order, `┊`-joined under the separator law: product + rev · wall
time · turn count · tokens sent/received summed over **every provider turn**
(the billing measure — unlike the per-task divider) · the cached share of
sent tokens. **Numbers are honest** (§11): a field the runtime did not
measure is omitted, never guessed; a session with no turns prints nothing —
a receipt for nothing is noise.

---

## 10 · Overlays

Overlays are **docked, frameless menus** above the composer — the same grammar
as the tool blocks (§8) and the start-page launcher (§12.5), never a bordered
dialog. There is **no box-drawing frame, no shadow, no scrim.** Structure comes
from three parts, built by one shared renderer (`overlay_menu`):

- a **bold uppercase title** header (omitted for the title-less SlashMenu);
- **rows** whose highlight is the `surface` fill across the menu measure — never
  a border, never a colored accent — with a bold label; `◉`/`○` mark a
  current/enabled row (never `[x]`);
- an optional **dim key-hint footer**, set off by one blank row.

The composer's top edge sits directly below, so the menu needs no frame of its
own to read as a distinct region.

- **SlashMenu** — command palette (§9.5). Title-less: just the rows.
- **Picker** — **tasks** and resume. Rows: `[◉ if active] label … meta hint`.
  The model switcher, scoped-models, providers, and project-permissions surfaces
  are **no longer pickers** — they are hatches inside the faceplate (§10.1).
  **Adjacent things share one picker** stands, now enforced *structurally*: the
  model hatch's own `reasoning` row IS the effort track (§10.1), so there is no
  second, duplicated track. `/model` and a bare `/reasoning` open the faceplate's
  ENGINE hatch; the typed forms (`/model <id>`, `/reasoning <level>`) stay the
  fast path. Never a second bespoke list for a sibling of an existing surface.
- **Settings panel** — the faceplate (§10.1). Not a category tree. Its ports are
  **hatches, not doors**: they expand in place, never swapping to another modal.
- **HelpOverlay** — the `?` cheatsheet: grouped key→action rows (keys in ink,
  actions muted, quiet uppercase group headings). No color, no icons.

### 10.1 The settings panel — the faceplate

`/settings` is ONE flat control surface, like the printed back panel of a lab
instrument: every setting is a row, grouped under dim uppercase **silkscreen
section headers** (`ENGINE · SAFETY · MEMORY · CHECKS · PANEL · GIT` — what
runs → what it may do → what it remembers → how it self-checks → the panel
itself → where it works), and adjusted **in place**. No sub-menu is ever
opened to change a value; drilling three levels to flip a switch is the
anti-instrument.

```
SETTINGS                                                    iris 0.1.0

  microcompaction   ○ off  ◉ on
  watermark         ●●●●●○○○○○  32k tokens

↑↓ select · ←→ set · esc close
```

Pressing `↵` on a `▸` port **expands it in place** — the marker flips to `▾`
and the surface's rows print indented directly beneath, inside the same panel.
The model hatch open, its `reasoning` row live-tracking the highlighted
candidate:

```
ENGINE
  model             ▾ gpt-5.5 ┊ openai-codex
    ◉ gpt-5.5                          openai-codex   default
    ○ claude-sonnet-5                  anthropic
    ○ gemini-3-pro                     google
  reasoning         ○ off  ○ minimal  ○ low  ◉ medium  ○ high  ○ xhigh
  model scope       ▸ all enabled

←→ reasoning · ↵ set default · s session · esc collapse
```

**Masthead.** Row one is the panel's silkscreen: bold `SETTINGS`, the crate
rev right-bound on the panel measure (the same identity print as the start
page and the exit receipt). It is pinned — a windowed panel scrolls its
sections under it, never past it.

**Four control archetypes** — a closed set, like the four tool families.
Never invent a fifth:

- **switch** — a fixed vocabulary printed as a labeled detent track
  (`○ strict  ◉ auto  ○ never`). `←`/`→` click one detent and **clamp at the
  stops** (a real switch never wraps; against the stop is a silent no-op).
  Bools are two-position switches (`○ off  ◉ on`). The `◉` is the handle —
  orange wherever it sits (selection color, not state color); the one guarded
  switch (`skip approvals`) paints its handle **danger red in the on
  position** and carries a permanent dim caution silkscreen
  (`dangerous ┊ session only`). When the labeled track does not fit the
  width, the row degrades to its **rotary form** — position dots + the
  selected value (`○○◉○○  medium`) — width alone decides, per row.
- **dial** — a numeric on a **10-detent ladder** rendered as the house 10-dot
  meter (filled `●`, orange edge, dim `○`) plus the honest printed value
  (`232k tokens` — the ONE house token format). `←`/`→` step to the
  neighbouring detent; an off-ladder value (hand-edited json) snaps into the
  ladder on its first click while the printed number stays true. `↵` opens an
  inline register for a precise value, clamped to the field's hard bounds.
- **register** — free text edited inline on the row: `↵` edits (buffer + the
  `▋` caret), `↵` saves, `esc` cancels, an empty buffer clears the key when
  the field allows it; a rejected buffer shows an inline danger token
  (`■ whole numbers only`), never a modal.
- **port** — a `▸` row that is a **hatch, not a door**: `↵` expands it in place
  to `▾` + indented child rows inside the same panel (model picker, model scope,
  providers, project permissions). **One hatch open at a time** (accordion —
  expanding one folds any other in the same keypress); `↵` on the `▾` header or
  `esc` anywhere folds it (cursor lands back on the header); `←`/`→` are never
  collapse verbs. The panel never leaves — no surface replacement, no frame
  without the faceplate. Child rows print at a four-cell indent and degrade like
  their archetypes at narrow widths; the footer is contextual to the selected
  child (its true verbs). The **model row is a rotary–port hybrid**: `←`/`→`
  cycles the scoped models exactly like Ctrl+P (the row rebuilds on the new
  engine and flashes), `↵` expands the hatch; its footer names both verbs
  (`←→ cycle · ↵ open`). The collapsed value prints the **active session
  engine** (not the persisted default); a session-only `s` pick that diverges
  from the default carries a quiet `· session` tag so the row never lies about
  what is running. Inside the model hatch the panel's own `reasoning` row
  IS the effort track — arrowing over candidates re-renders it with that model's
  levels, target clamped, and there is no duplicated second track.
  **Dialog-guard exception:** three genuine interrupts (the large-context switch
  advisory, the OAuth login dialog, the API-key dialog) still overlay the
  faceplate; when one resolves — any path — the panel's snapshot is refreshed (a
  login can grow the catalog) and it reopens expanded with the cursor intact,
  *before the next draw*, so the dock never collapses for a frame.

**Mechanics.** `↑`/`↓` move over controls (wrapping; headers and blanks are
skipped — silkscreen is not selectable). Every adjustment **saves
immediately** (position IS state, like a physical switch) and the changed
element renders bright for two ticks — the §6 detent flash, on the same tick
grid as the statusline detents, settled instantly under reduced motion. The
theme row is a **live rotary**: each click re-skins the whole pane before
your eyes. A **dependent control dims to inert hardware** while its master is
off (the watermark under `microcompaction ○ off`) but stays operable. The
footer prints only the selected row's true verbs (`←→ set` · `←→ adjust · ↵
type` · `↵ edit` · `↵ open` — keymap honesty per archetype).

**Height honesty.** On a tall pane the whole faceplate prints at once. On a
short one the panel windows itself under the pinned session bar and above the
protected composer, scrolling with the house `(n/N)` position row — never
clipped, never painted under other chrome. The design floor is a 12-row
terminal: panels window all the way down to it; below that floor the footer
may clip.

**Pruning.** The faceplate is curated; the service hatch is `settings.json`.
Niche flags (bash tool mode, tool round-trip caps, retry tuning, custom
endpoint blocks) stay json-only. Every panel row must earn its silkscreen.

---

## 11 · Casing & content

- **Sentence case** for all prose.
- **UPPERCASE** is reserved for structural labels: tool families
  (`SHELL`/`EXPLORE`/`EDIT`), states
  (`DONE`/`RUNNING`/`ERROR`/`REVIEW`/`DENIED`/…), mode (`CODE`), section labels
  (`PLAN`/`THINKING`), and `EXIT`. **Never** uppercase for emphasis in prose.
- **Numbers are honest.** Token telemetry (`↑177k ↓5.7k`), durations (`7.6s`,
  `1:27`), counts — shown compactly and only when real. Never assert savings the
  runtime hasn't measured.
- **Brevity.** Hints are short and inline (`↵ to send · shift+↵ for new line · /
  for commands`), `·`-joined — `•` stays the markdown bullet's alone (§5). At a
  narrow width a hint row drops whole trailing fields, never clipping one
  mid-word: a printed control either fits or is omitted. Placeholders use exact product casing.
- **Emoji: none, ever.** State is carried by the glyph vocabulary.
- **Progressive disclosure.** Minimal at a glance; complete and structured on
  demand (`ctrl+o`). Nothing important is hidden; nothing trivial is shouted.

---

## 12 · Accessibility & the monochrome test

- **The monochrome test is a hard gate.** Desaturate the whole pane: every state
  must still be unambiguous from symbol + label + position. If a state is only
  distinguishable by hue, it is broken.
- Live regions: the working indicator is `role="status"`; the context meter is
  `role="meter"` with `aria-valuenow`; decorative glyphs are `aria-hidden`.
- All motion respects `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- Contrast: ink on bg and muted on bg both clear the terminal-legibility bar in
  both themes; stdout grey is deliberately recessive but still readable.

---

## 12.5 · The start page

Shown when Iris launches interactively with no task and no resume target —
before any transcript exists. Same pane chrome (session bar on top, composer
on bottom, both live), with the launcher centered in the empty transcript
area. Entering a session replaces the launcher with the normal transcript;
nothing else changes — that is the point of the shared chrome. On the start
page the session bar shows the launch cwd/branch and an empty meter
(`CTX 0/<cap>`, all `○`).

The launcher **is the home menu**: `New session` · `Resume session` · `Tasks` ·
`Settings` · `Quit`, each a keyboard row (`↑`/`↓` + `↵`, or the `ctrl-` chord).
`Tasks` opens the unified task surface (`/tasks`, §10 Picker). Recoverable Iris
tasks (ADR-0031) are surfaced **here** — a dim `· N to recover` badge on the
`Tasks` row — never a picker forced open over the menu on launch.

◉ CODE ─ GPT-5.5 XHIGH ─ ◆ always-approve
```

**IrisMark.** The logo IS an LED strip — no ASCII art, no figlet wordmark, no
pictorial glyph. One row of 12 dots (`●`/`○` cells, single-spaced), centered. A
single lit orange head sweeps back and forth (ping-pong: reverses at the ends,
never wrapping), advancing one dot per ~130ms tick, with a 2-dot comet trail
behind the travel direction (trail-1 non-bold orange, trail-2 dimmest; head
bright orange). All other dots are dim `○`. It reuses the working indicator's
tick machinery: it stops when the terminal is unfocused, and under
`IRIS_REDUCED_MOTION` it holds a single static lit dot at the center.

**Silkscreen.** One row directly under the strip — printed faceplate text, so
it is visible from the first frame and never animates: the letter-spaced
wordmark `I R I S` anchored to the strip's **left** edge, the crate rev
anchored to its **right** edge (dim). Wordmark in body ink, plain weight — the
LEDs stay the only bright element. This is the interface's one version
surface and its only wordmark; still no ASCII art, no figlet.

**Power-on.** An interactive launch runs the **lamp test** (§6 motion 3):
frame 0 shows the silkscreen printed, the strip dark, and the menu hidden
(blank rows — the block's height never changes, so nothing reflows); the
LEDs then fill left-to-right two per tick, hold all-lit for two ticks —
every LED proves itself — and release into the idle ping-pong as the menu
rows go live. Any key completes the boot instantly and still performs its
normal action; the composer is live throughout; under reduced motion the
page starts settled. The boot exists only here: launching with a task or a
resume target powers straight into work, no ceremony.

**Launcher.** A keyboard-navigable list (~44 columns, centered, one blank row
below the mark) in the house picker idiom — NO hairline dividers between rows:
a 1-col `◉` orange marker on the selected row, the action label (bold when
selected), a dim dotted leader, and the right-aligned dim key hint. The
selected row gets the `surface` fill across the menu width. `↑`/`↓` move the
selection (wrapping), `↵` activates, and the listed `ctrl-` chords activate
directly. The composer input stays live: typing a task and pressing `↵`
starts the session with it.

## 13 · Invariants (golden tests — a build MUST satisfy)

1. **One column.** No sidebar, no tabs, no separate status bar (the split
   statusline lives on the session bar and inside the composer).
2. **One blank line** between every top-level block. No other gap value.
3. **Shared measure.** Panels + composer share one width and a 2-cell indent;
   every body (prose, tool, reasoning) hangs on ONE text column, and every
   right-aligned readout (elapsed, telemetry, diagnostics) aligns to ONE right
   rail. Indentation is hierarchy, stepped in 2-cell units (gutter · label ·
   body, §4) — never an ad-hoc indent.
4. **Block rows** are each exactly one of {header·body·footer rule·footer} and
   all share one width; no row overflows the block's rails.
   4a. **One marked voice.** The transcript marks the user's turn with a `›` in
   the gutter and nothing else; the agent speaks unmarked (§7.1–7.2).
5. **Three tool families only** (EXPLORE / SHELL / EDIT). No standalone
   READ/GREP/LS/DIFF panels; approval is an in-block lifecycle state, never a
   separate panel.
6. **Chrome is for tools.** Conversation, thinking, plans, and notices are never
   boxed. Boxes are never used for prose. **Overlays are frameless too** — menus,
   pickers, and the slash palette carry no box-drawing frame; selection is the
   `surface` fill (§10).
7. **Square corners always** (`--radius: 0`).
8. **State = symbol + label + color**, never color alone; the pane passes the
   monochrome test.
9. **One type size.** Hierarchy never uses a larger font in the pane.
10. **Closed symbol set.** No glyph outside §5; `…`/`−`/`┊` (not `...`/`-`/`|`);
    no emoji.
11. **Composer is unconditional.** No show/hide/reveal/collapse mechanic.
12. **Motion** is only the closed quantized set of §6 — LED chase (working
    indicator + IrisMark), edge pulse, the start page's one-shot lamp test,
    and the two-tick detent flash — all stepped on the tick grid, all
    reduced-motion safe, and none of them ambient.

## 14 · Anti-patterns (do NOT)

- ✗ A role card / bubble / avatar for user or assistant messages.
- ✗ Marking the **agent** with a `›` (it decorates the dominant voice); mark the user's turn instead (§7.1).
- ✗ An ad-hoc indent that doesn't land on the gutter/label/body ladder, or a right-aligned readout inset differently from the tool elapsed (§4).
- ✗ A colored left-border accent on active rows (use the `surface` fill).
- ✗ Boxing a code block, a plan, a notice, or tool output — nothing in the transcript is boxed.
- ✗ A braille spinner, a rainbow/percentage meter, or an animated progress bar.
- ✗ A larger font, all-caps prose, or bold-for-emphasis to signal importance.
- ✗ Emoji, gradients, rounded corners, drop shadows in the transcript, glass/blur.
- ✗ ASCII `|` separators, ASCII `-` removals, or `...` ellipses.
- ✗ Asserting efficiency/savings the runtime has not measured.
- ✗ A fifth tool family, or a standalone READ/GREP/LS/DIFF panel.
