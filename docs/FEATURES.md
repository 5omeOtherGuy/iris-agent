## Core CLI and agent loop

- **CLI entrypoint** — `cargo run` starts Iris. [Implemented]
- **Interactive terminal session** — terminal-surface TUI on real TTYs with an
  Iris-owned transcript replay/diff renderer, textarea editor, spinner, slash
  palette, modal selectors, live bash exec cells, compact tool timers,
  state-specific panel symbols, `ctrl+o` output preview/reveal, word-level diff
  highlights, streamed GFM-style Markdown rendering, collapsed reasoning panels,
  `/exit` and `/quit`; text REPL fallback for pipes/CI or TUI startup failure.
  [Implemented]
- **Alt-screen pager TUI** — full-frame alternate-screen renderer
  ([ADR-0029](adr/0029-adopt-alt-screen-pager-tui.md)): viewport-pinned
  session bar, Iris-owned scrollback with follow mode
  (PageUp/PageDown, Alt+Up/Down line scroll, Home/End, mouse wheel at
  `tui.scrollSpeed` lines/tick, re-engage by overscroll, dim `▾ N lines
  below` indicator), O(viewport) windowed rendering over the wrap cache,
  panic-safe alt-screen restore, mouse capture with a runtime toggle (Ctrl+T
  / `/mouse`; off restores terminal-native select/copy, statusline shows
  `○ mouse off`), clipboard ladder (native tools → OSC 52) behind `/copy`.
  Policy: `tui.altScreen = auto|always|never` (default `auto`),
  `--no-alt-screen`, `IRIS_NO_ALT_SCREEN`; tmux control mode, Zellij, dumb
  terminals, and non-TTY stdio degrade to the inline renderer with a notice.
  The `/terminal-setup` capability doctor is next. [Partial]
- **Conversation state** — in-memory multi-turn user/assistant messages for the
  current process, plus linear session resume from persisted transcripts.
  [Partial]
- **Provider-neutral turn/message shape** — `ChatProvider`, `AssistantTurn`,
  `ToolCall`, `Message`, `Role`, and provider-neutral assistant-reasoning rows
  plus display events in Nexus. [Partial]
- **Provider error reporting** — provider errors print to stderr and the REPL
  continues. [Partial]
- **Streaming responses** — incremental assistant text output via the async
  `ChatProvider::respond_stream` → `Stream<ProviderEvent>` contract, consumed by
  the tokio agent loop and rendered as `UiEvent` deltas. [Implemented]
- **TUI transcript rendering** — assistant text supports Markdown tables,
  task-list checkboxes, strikethrough, themed spans, Unicode-aware
  wrap/truncate behavior, and collapsed `Thinking...` panels for provider
  reasoning when the provider supplies displayable reasoning. Redacted reasoning
  never renders provider-hidden text. [Implemented]
- **Runtime-hard cancellation** — per-turn `CancellationToken`, provider
  stream-vs-cancel race, tool-vs-cancel race, child cancellation per tool, and a
  real-or-synthetic cancelled tool result for every emitted call so the
  transcript stays valid on abort. (Caveat: a blocking terminal approval prompt
  is not preempted until the second Ctrl-C.) [Implemented]
- **Safe parallel tool execution** — sequential by default; consecutive
  concurrency-safe, ungated tools (`grep`/`find`/`ls`) run in parallel with
  bounded ordered buffering while unsafe/mutating tools stay exclusive.
  [Implemented]
- **Session transcript persistence** — best-effort JSONL read/write store:
  `SessionLog` appends v2 transcript entries with stable ids, `parentId`, and
  token estimates, plus compaction and model-selection audit entries;
  `SessionStore` lists/finds/opens sessions, rebuilds context through
  compaction summaries, and `iris resume <id>` continues the same log. Complete
  provider round trips flush before the next provider request; a final/error
  turn-boundary flush remains the backstop. Branching/rollback and an
  in-session resume picker are planned later. [Partial]

## Providers and auth

- **OpenAI Codex Responses provider** — uses the ChatGPT Codex Responses endpoint
  with tool schemas, retry/backoff, and streamed response parsing, exposed as the
  async streaming `ChatProvider::respond_stream` contract (blocking reqwest/SSE
  code runs on `spawn_blocking` and forwards `ProviderEvent`s over a channel,
  cancellation-aware across attempts/backoff/SSE lines). [Partial]
- **Anthropic Messages provider** — uses the Claude Code subscription OAuth lane
  (bearer token, no `x-api-key`), Anthropic Messages SSE, Claude Code identity
  system block, subscription model matrix, tool schemas, streamed text,
  tool-call assembly, normalized reasoning budgets/effort, redacted diagnostics,
  same-origin reasoning replay, cache-control markers when enabled, and supported
  context-management clear edits. Credentials come from the Iris auth store or an
  existing Claude Code login. [Partial]
- **Antigravity provider** — uses Google OAuth for Gemini Code Assist
  (`v1internal:streamGenerateContent?alt=sse`), project-id discovery/persistence,
  Gemini content/tool mapping, streamed text, tool-call assembly, and normalized
  thinking config. Gemini tool-call `thoughtSignature` values are persisted and
  replayed so follow-up requests after tool use stay valid. The public installed-
  app client ID is decoded at runtime; `ANTIGRAVITY_CLIENT_SECRET` is supplied at
  runtime or injected when building Iris. [Partial]
- **OpenAI Codex OAuth auth-file support** — reads `~/.iris/auth.json` or
  `IRIS_AUTH_PATH`, refreshes expired access tokens, extracts account ID from the
  JWT payload, and rewrites refreshed credentials atomically with restricted Unix
  permissions. [Partial]
- **Anthropic Claude Code credential reuse and login** — runs browser PKCE OAuth
  with manual paste fallback, reads `~/.claude/.credentials.json` (or
  `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/.credentials.json`) when the Iris auth store does not
  already hold Anthropic credentials, and writes rotated tokens back to the same
  source without reshaping or dropping sibling keys. [Partial]
- **Antigravity Google OAuth login** — browser PKCE OAuth callback flow through
  `iris login antigravity`; requires `ANTIGRAVITY_CLIENT_SECRET` unless the
  binary was built with it, and uses the same value for later refreshes. [Partial]
- **OpenAI Codex login** — browser OAuth callback flow and device-code OAuth flow
  through `iris login openai-codex`. [Partial]
- **Provider configuration** — `defaultProvider`, `defaultModel`, and `baseUrl`
  settings; supported provider ids are `openai-codex`, `anthropic`, and
  `antigravity`. Project-local settings may override only `defaultModel`,
  `defaultReasoning`, `contextTokenBudget`, `compactionSummarizer`, and the
  project-safe fields of `compaction`; global settings own provider, base-url,
  model-cycle scope, compaction worker model, and provider-native mode so a
  cloned repo cannot redirect bearer tokens or silently change which provider
  a session cycles to.
  OpenAI Codex additionally supports `IRIS_MODEL` and `IRIS_CODEX_BASE_URL` env
  overrides. `contextTokenBudget` clamps the model-aware compaction window,
  `compactionSummarizer` picks who writes compaction summaries
  (`subagent`/`provider`/`excerpts`), `defaultReasoning` sets startup
  thinking/effort, and
  `enabledModels` scopes Ctrl+P model cycling from global/user config only.
  [Partial]
- **Provider-native prompt cache controls** — global-only `promptCacheRetention`
  supports `none`, `short` (default), and `long`. OpenAI receives
  `prompt_cache_key` and optional 24h retention; Anthropic receives
  `cache_control` markers with optional 1h TTL. Iris records provider usage/cache
  metadata and warns only on proven stable-prefix breaks, not ordinary cold
  caches. [Partial]
- **Anthropic context-management opt-in** — global-only
  `anthropicContextManagement` supports the public clear-tool-use and
  clear-thinking edits; provider-side compact is rejected until Iris can persist
  and replay compaction blocks safely. [Partial]
- **Recoverable tool-result compaction** — default-off
  `toolResultCompaction` composes retain-N stale-read dedupe with local
  age/count clearing. Shared count/token guards protect the recent working set;
  durable fold entries preserve provider tool-pair invariants; originals remain
  recoverable from session JSONL with `recall(tool_call_id="...")`. Four cache
  timing policies choose explicit breaks, inferred-cold windows, pressure, or
  immediate safe boundaries. The legacy `microcompaction` setting resolves to
  the ADR-0048 conservative `toolResultCompaction` policy and retains its
  independent 64,000-token watermark. [Implemented]
- **Anthropic-native tool clearing** — explicit `anthropicNative` or `auto`
  backends map the public `clear_tool_uses_20250919` trigger, keep, minimum,
  excluded-tool, and tool-input controls. Provider selection rejects overlapping
  local/native tool sets; `auto` falls back to local when native clearing is
  unsupported or cannot honor the configured safety policy. [Implemented]
- **Runtime model and reasoning switching** — `/model`, `/reasoning`, TUI
  provider/model/effort pickers, Ctrl+P/Shift+Ctrl+P model cycling,
  Shift+Tab effort cycling, `/settings`, `/scoped-models`, and session-local or
  persisted defaults at safe turn boundaries. [Implemented]
- **Token-efficient switching** — switches classify as reasoning-only (prefix
  unchanged, silent), model change, or provider change; a model/provider switch
  carrying a large context (over a quarter of the budget) advises `/compact`
  before the new model re-reads it uncached, and foreign-origin reasoning rows
  are never replayed to any provider after a switch. (ADR-0041) [Implemented]
- **TUI auth selectors** — `/login` and `/logout` modals show no-secret provider
  status and drive existing OAuth/subscription flows where available. [Implemented]
- **Session utility commands** — `/session` (transcript file, id, message counts,
  context-token estimate, active model), `/copy` (last assistant reply to the
  system clipboard via pbcopy/wl-copy/xclip/xsel with an OSC 52 fallback for SSH
  sessions), and `/debug` (pi-mono-style snapshot of the rendered screen and the
  provider-visible context written to `~/.iris/iris-debug.log`; `/dbug` alias).
  `/copy` and `/session` also work in the text fallback. [Implemented]
- **Model catalog** — hand-maintained provider/model list for picker display and
  authenticated-model filtering, including current Codex, Anthropic subscription,
  and Antigravity entries. [Implemented]
- **Additional providers** — OpenAI API, local, or OpenAI-compatible backends.
  [Planned]
- **Provider capability matrix** — per-model context window, cache support,
  tool-call format, reasoning controls, JSON reliability, and image support.
  [Partial]

## Agent Kernel MVP tools

- **Tool-call loop** — send tool schemas, receive tool calls, execute async tools,
  and feed tool results back to the model. There is no fixed default round-trip
  cap; `maxToolRoundtrips` can add a graceful soft cap when configured. Runs on
  the tokio loop with per-turn/per-tool cancellation and safe-parallel batching
  of concurrency-safe calls. [Implemented]
- **`read` tool** — read a workspace text file with offset/limit; rejects
  binary/NUL-containing and invalid UTF-8 files rather than rendering lossy
  text. [Implemented]
- **`read` multimodal inputs** — PDF, notebook, and image reading. Nice-to-have
  explicitly deferred until after the core coding-agent workflow is solid.
  [Planned]
- **`write` tool** — create or overwrite a workspace file with atomic
  same-directory replacement. [Implemented]
- **`edit` tool** — targeted exact-string replacement in an existing file
  (Claude Code-compatible `file_path`/`old_string`/`new_string`/`replace_all`),
  including whitespace-normalized fallback matching and atomic replacement.
  [Implemented]
- **`bash` tool** — run a shell command in the workspace with captured output,
  per-call timeout handling when requested, and nonzero-exit reporting. Iris no
  longer applies a default timeout to every bash call. [Implemented]
- **`grep` tool** — search workspace file contents in-process via the ripgrep
  library crates (no `rg` binary required). Content mode groups matches under
  each file path and takes an opt-in `maxPerFile` cap that summarizes overflow
  matches per file with an exact count line (shown plus omitted equals the
  total; nothing dropped silently). Measured on a committed corpus
  (`docs/benchmarks/issue-338-grep-output-tokens.md`). [Implemented]
- **`find` tool** — find workspace files in-process via `ignore` + `globset`
  (no `fd` binary required). A truncated result ends with an exact total match
  count and the top directories by omitted-match count; results group by
  directory when that is smaller than the flat listing. Measured on a committed
  corpus (`docs/benchmarks/issue-340-find-compaction.md`). [Implemented]
- **`ls` tool** — list workspace directory entries, directories first, with an
  optional recursive tree and an optional `long` mode (type marker + human-
  readable size per entry). [Implemented]
- **Tool result/error encoding** — structured success/error responses returned to
  the model, including a per-tool `metadata` object on success (e.g. `read`
  byte/line counts and `truncated`, `ls` entry count). Successful outputs over
  50 KiB are stored out of context behind an `outputHandle` when a session store
  is attached. [Implemented]

## Safety and approvals

- **Workspace path safety** — keep file tools inside the workspace by default,
  including policy for absolute paths, `..`, symlinks, binary files, and large
  files. [Partial]
- **Approval gates** — explicit confirmation for `write`, `edit`, and `bash`
  (every mutating file/shell tool), with denied-call handling. [Implemented]
- **Per-project permission policy** — persistent per-cwd grants (ADR-0027,
  #209): per-tool approval defaults for `write`/`edit` and per-command `bash`
  allows (exact or prefix), stored HOME-owned in `~/.iris/trust.json` keyed by
  canonical directory; `[p]` at the approval prompt persists a grant and
  `/trust` (alias: `/permissions`) lists/toggles/revokes them. Destructive commands always re-prompt
  and are never grantable; a repo-committed file can never grant. Sandbox
  posture is stored per project but not yet enforced. [Implemented]
- **Atomic file replacement** — `write` and `edit` write through a
  same-directory temp file, fsync, rename, cleanup-on-error path, and Unix
  permission preservation on overwrite. [Partial]
- **Bash policy** — cwd, optional per-call timeout, stdout/stderr capture,
  output limits, nonzero-exit handling, process-group cleanup, persistent
  sessions, background jobs, and Linux Landlock confinement where available.
  [Partial]
- **File observation / stale mutation preflight** — session-scoped observation
  store records each file's `{mtime, content_hash}` on read/write/edit; `edit`
  and `write` reject mutating an existing file that was never read or has
  changed since last read, and refresh the observation after each mutation. New
  files may still be created blind. [Implemented]
- **Diff/preview approval UX** — show unified diffs or capped new-file previews
  before mutating file tools. [Implemented]
- **Secret redaction** — redact secrets from stored content and summaries.
  [Planned]
- **Subagent tool permissions** — per-worker tool allowlists. [Planned]

## Token and context engine

These are core to the long-term Iris thesis, but they are not part of the first
Agent Kernel MVP unless a milestone explicitly pulls them forward.

- **Context token estimates and budget trigger** — session entries persist
  conservative token estimates, reopened sessions report rebuilt context tokens,
  and `contextTokenBudget` clamps auto-compaction at turn edges and continuing
  provider-round-trip boundaries. [Implemented]
- **Token budget planner** — allocates context across system prompt, tools,
  history, files, summaries, and current task. [Planned]
- **Context ledger** — records why each context item is included and supports
  reason-based eviction. [Planned]
- **Session-scoped content-addressed output store** — oversized tool outputs are
  stored beside the session transcript in `<session>.outputs/` by stable
  truncated SHA-256 handle. Files/web pages/diffs/summaries are not yet covered.
  [Partial]
- **Native bash output filtering** — captured command output is reduced at one
  seam before `truncate_tail` and the transcript: structured Rust filters for
  cargo test/build/check/clippy, git status/log/diff, and npm/pnpm test
  (jest/vitest); declarative TOML filters for ~60 more commands. Fail-safe raw
  fallback, failure detail verbatim, `raw: true` bypass; reduction measured on
  a committed corpus (`docs/benchmarks/adr-0037-bash-filter-tokens.md`,
  ADR-0036/0037). [Implemented]
- **Handle-returning tool outputs** — large successful tool outputs return a
  compact head/tail preview, structured `outputHandle` metadata, and a handle to
  full content. [Implemented]
- **Handle dereferencing** — retrieve stored content by handle on demand.
  [Planned]
- **Micro-summary schema** — deterministic schema for counts, truncation, size,
  and confidence. [Planned]
- **Handle lifecycle** — session-scoped retention with ref-counting or
  pin-on-reference. [Planned]
- **Prompt segment caching** — default-short provider-native cache hints for
  stable prompt segments where providers expose public controls; local KV
  caching and private/provider-specific continuity tricks remain deferred.
  [Partial]
- **Cache-aware prompt layout** — providers receive stable prompt/tool prefixes,
  prompt-cache opt-ins, provider usage/cache metadata, and proven cache-break
  diagnostics. More explicit layout planning remains planned. [Partial]
- **Diff-aware file context** — prioritize git diff, touched files, nearby symbols,
  and recent edits over whole files. [Planned]
- **Provider-specific tool surface planner** — Nexus separates the
  model-visible tool surface from the execution registry; providers can hide a
  built-in from declarations while keeping it runnable for existing transcript
  references. Mode/task-specific planning remains planned. [Partial]
- **Compressed tool schemas** — minimal, strict, provider-compatible tool schemas.
  [Planned]

## Compaction

- **Durable compaction entries** — JSONL `compaction` entries replace covered
  message-id ranges with summary messages during read/resume rebuild. [Implemented]
- **Auto-compaction** — Mimir resolves the selected model's effective window;
  Wayland combines provider usage with estimates for unseen messages and applies
  a configurable warn/start/hard ladder before, during, and after turns. Between
  provider round trips, Nexus consults a provider-neutral governor only after
  complete tool-call/result groups and before steering injection. Ready workers
  apply without waiting; hard pressure bounds worker wait and falls back to
  deterministic excerpts. An explicit `contextTokenBudget` clamps the resolved
  window. Active worker ranges freeze overlapping folds. Branch-aware
  compaction remains planned. (ADR-0054, ADR-0055) [Partial]
- **Background summaries** — `compactionSummarizer` selects the answering
  worker. `compaction.worker.input` defaults to a verbatim transcript request;
  `investigator` enables read-only workspace probes. Transcript overflow
  shrinks the covered slice and retries finitely. An optional global-only
  `worker.model` routes the worker through Mimir. The parent alone validates,
  persists, and applies. Entries record origin, instructions, and reported
  worker token/cache usage. (ADR-0041) [Implemented]
- **Manual `/compact [focus]`** — uses the same one-slot worker pipeline at the
  inter-turn boundary. It attaches to an existing job, supports a bounded focus
  instruction, keeps a small recent tail, and works without a budget.
  [Implemented]
- **Hierarchical compaction** — layered raw turns, compacted older turns, task
  facts, file-change facts, decisions/blockers, and project memory. [Research]
- **Freshness rules** — mark summaries stale when underlying files change.
  [Research]
- **Verification probes** — measure compaction recall and quality. [Research]

## Prompt assembly

- **Fragment-based system prompt** — Wayland assembles provider-visible
  instructions from in-binary shipped fragments (the single source of truth,
  ADR-0026), project docs (`AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md`), runtime context, and
  generated live-tool blocks. No `.md` fragment files are loaded from disk.
  [Implemented]
- **Fragment ordering** — internal fragments use `name` for XML tags and
  numeric `slot` ordering (`slot: 0` disables). [Implemented]
- **Named slots and selector schema** — replace numeric slots with named slots
  and drive prompt/tool inclusion from resolved provider/model/thinking/mode.
  [Planned]

## Skills

- **Codex-compatible filesystem format** — recursively load `SKILL.md` files
  with validated YAML `name`/`description` metadata, frontmatter short
  descriptions, and optional `agents/openai.yaml` interface, dependency, and
  policy metadata. [Implemented]
- **Repo, user, system, and admin discovery** — scan `.agents/skills` from
  repository root to cwd, legacy `<repo>/.codex/skills`, `~/.agents/skills`,
  existing `$CODEX_HOME/skills` plus its bundled `.system` root,
  `~/.iris/skills`, and administrator roots. Canonical-path dedupe, bounded
  depth/count, symlinked directories, and non-fatal load errors match Codex's
  local loader behavior. [Implemented]
- **Codex config compatibility** — honor `skills.include_instructions` and
  ordered name/path `skills.config` enable rules from Codex's config. Optional
  malformed metadata fails open. [Implemented]
- **Progressive disclosure** — expose name, description, and source path under
  a 2% context budget; load the full `SKILL.md` only after selection. Catalog
  changes inject at turn boundaries without rewriting the system prompt.
  [Implemented]
- **Explicit and implicit invocation** — unique `$skill-name` and
  path-qualified picker mentions inject the selected body; the model can select
  implicitly from descriptions unless `allow_implicit_invocation` is false.
  [Implemented]
- **TUI discovery** — `$` and `/skills` open a searchable selector; selecting a
  duplicate name inserts its exact `skill://` path. Interface display names and
  short descriptions appear when present. [Implemented]
- **Confined resource reads** — a loaded skill extends `read` with its own
  canonical directory only. References work under workspace confinement;
  sibling paths and out-of-workspace mutation remain denied. [Implemented]

## Modes

- **Mode switching** — switch named mode profiles mid-session. Runtime
  provider/model/thinking switching exists separately today. [Planned]
- **Switch reuse** — reuse assembled context on switch and change only
  mode-specific prompt/tool segments when possible. [Planned]
- **Mode profiles** — prompt shape, tool set, compaction policy, and model
  preference. [Planned]

## Subagents

- **Subagent backend contract** — Wayland owns spawn/poll/wait/cancel handles,
  request validation, lifecycle status, budgets, allowlists, output-handle
  fields, and read-only child execution. Issue
  [#460](https://github.com/5omeOtherGuy/iris-agent/issues/460). [Implemented]
- **Mutable subagent backend: worktree isolation** — read-write workers are gated
  on the worktree service from the Git section (#271): linked worktree creation,
  durable registry, progress/lifecycle state, explicit apply, and
  `list/show/rm/gc`. The read-only backend contract is already shipped; mutable
  subagents must not fall back to in-place parent-workspace mutation. [Planned]
- **Advanced worktree backend slices** — snapshot fast paths, worktree
  pooling/adoption, and remote session/codebase restore are desired follow-ups
  after the linked-worktree apply boundary is correct. [Planned]
- **Subagents as tools** — main agent invokes subagents through Nexus tool
  execution under a final model-facing name that is not `task`. [Planned]
- **Worker set** — search, advisor/reviewer, repo researcher, task worker, and
  user-defined custom subagents. [Planned]
- **Per-worker model routing** — each worker resolves its own provider/model/
  thinking level without changing the parent. [Planned]
- **Isolated worker context by default** — worker runs a fresh conversation with
  only its task prompt. [Planned]
- **Curated context forwarding** — forward selected context-ledger entries to a
  worker by reference. [Planned]
- **Handle-returning workers** — workers return handle plus micro-summary.
  [Planned]
- **Per-worker budgets** — enforced max turns and token caps. [Planned]
- **Filtered tool access** — read-only workers enforce capability filters before
  inference and execution; mutable/execute worker filters are planned. [Partial]
- **Background fleet** — independent workers run in parallel with live grouped
  status. [Planned]

## Edits

- **Content-hash anchored edits** — model references content-hash anchors instead
  of retyping surrounding lines. Anchor format, duplicate handling, stale-anchor
  detection, fallback, and verification are unspecified. [Research]

## Git

Design for the first slice (dirty-tree safety, checkpoint/rollback, final diff,
verification loop) is accepted in
[ADR-0028](adr/0028-git-workflow-dirty-tree-safety-and-task-checkpointing.md)
and tracked by epic
[#261](https://github.com/5omeOtherGuy/iris-agent/issues/261). Do not re-derive
task boundaries, checkpoint storage, or approval semantics — they are decided.

- **Dirty-state handling** — baseline + attribution ledger; never silently
  overwrite uncommitted work (files or index); per-file per-task approvals.
  Spec: ADR-0028; issue
  [#262](https://github.com/5omeOtherGuy/iris-agent/issues/262). [Implemented]
- **Checkpoint / rollback** — op-log-shaped checkpoint chain under
  `refs/iris/*`; task-scoped rollback restoring only Iris-authored changes, plus
  the user index; settlement ref teardown, crash-recovery reconciliation, 30-day
  expiry, non-git content-snapshot fallback, and
  `/rollback`/`/accept`/`/checkpoint`. `/checkpoint` is a non-settling save
  point; `/accept` accepts the current Iris changes and `/rollback` restores a
  rollback point.
  Spec: ADR-0028 + ADR-0052; issues
  [#263](https://github.com/5omeOtherGuy/iris-agent/issues/263) and
  [#448](https://github.com/5omeOtherGuy/iris-agent/issues/448). [Implemented]
- **Final diff summary** — net task diff (Iris-authored paths only, one hunk set
  per file) as the deliverable, TUI + plain-text, via `/diff` and the accept-flow
  summary; fails closed on an unreadable checkpoint. Issue
  [#264](https://github.com/5omeOtherGuy/iris-agent/issues/264). [Implemented]
- **Verification loop** — explicit per-project `verify.command` (+
  `verify.maxAttempts`, default 3, capped 10; no auto-detection) run after a turn
  that changed files, as a normal gated shell execution under the unchanged
  approval policy (no persistent allow-always per ADR-0010; any build artifacts
  go through the #262 dirty-tree guard). Failure output is fed back to the model
  for a bounded retry — each retry only after the model makes further changes,
  stopping at the cap. Honest pass / fail-after-N / skipped events; a failed loop
  never accepts the task, so it stays rollbackable. Issue
  [#265](https://github.com/5omeOtherGuy/iris-agent/issues/265). [Implemented]
- **Diff view** — present changes as git diffs. [Planned]
- **Auto-commit** — commit changes with generated messages after explicit
  approval. Gated on ADR-0028's still-binding pre-automation gate. Issue
  [#270](https://github.com/5omeOtherGuy/iris-agent/issues/270). [Planned]
- **Per-hunk staging** — stage and commit logically separate changes separately.
  Issue [#269](https://github.com/5omeOtherGuy/iris-agent/issues/269). [Planned]
- **Pre-commit self-review** — agent reviews its own diff before committing.
  [Planned]
- **Worktree integration** — isolated worktree plus branch per task/run; also the
  required mutable-subagent isolation primitive. Design ADR
  [ADR-0035](adr/0035-git-worktree-isolation-and-apply-as-settlement.md) is
  accepted and [#267](https://github.com/5omeOtherGuy/iris-agent/issues/267) is
  closed; implementation is tracked in
  [#271](https://github.com/5omeOtherGuy/iris-agent/issues/271). Read-write
  subagents must not ship without this isolation/apply boundary. Reference:
  [`.iris-reference/grok-worktree-subsystem-spec.md`](../.iris-reference/grok-worktree-subsystem-spec.md).
  [Planned]

## GitHub

- **PR lifecycle** — create, update, and describe pull requests. [Planned]
- **PR review** — read diffs, post inline comments, address feedback, resolve
  threads. [Planned]
- **Issues** — issue → task → linked PR → close on merge. [Planned]
- **CI iteration** — read check status, fetch failing logs, iterate until passing.
  [Planned]
- **Stacked PRs** — dependent PR stacks. [Planned]

## Plugins

> Exploratory, not a committed direction. A plugin system is a possibility we
> are keeping open — for tools, and potentially for other extension points — but
> Iris is **not** being built around it. WASM (Extism on Wasmtime) is one
> candidate backend, tracked in issue #18; a subprocess/stdio plugin protocol is
> another. Nothing here is scheduled, and the core does not depend on it.

If a plugin system is ever added, the likely shape is: built-in tools stay native
and trusted; plugins add new tools (or, with explicit opt-in, shadow a built-in),
run sandboxed with no raw workspace access, and reach the filesystem only through
explicit host capabilities that reuse the existing path-safety checks. It would
plug into the same core `ToolRegistry`/`Tool`-trait seam that modes, subagents,
and provider-specific tools need anyway (see
[`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md)), so that registry work is justified
independently of whether plugins ever ship.

- **Plugin system (tools and beyond)** — load third-party/custom extensions from
  a manifest. WASM/Extism and a subprocess protocol are both candidate backends;
  the choice is undecided. [Research]
- **Sandboxed plugin capabilities** — if plugins land, they get no raw workspace
  access and reach the filesystem only via explicit host functions that reuse
  Nexus path-safety; mutations would be plan-based and host-applied so plugin
  code never touches the filesystem or renders its own diffs. [Research]
- **Identity-based approval** — if plugins land, approval keys on tool identity
  (`plugin:<id>:<sha256>:<name>`) rather than bare name, so overrides and
  untrusted code cannot inherit a prior trust decision. [Research]

## Repo awareness

- **Current codemap** — source-grounded module map in `docs/CODEMAPS/INDEX.md`.
  [Implemented]
- **Tree-sitter repo map** — ranked-symbol map of the codebase. [Planned]

## Out of scope

- Pi execution modes as product surface: interactive / print-JSON / RPC over JSONL
  / SDK surface.
- SDK / embedding surface for building other agents.
